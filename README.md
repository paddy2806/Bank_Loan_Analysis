## 🔍 Example SQL Query Snippets

```sql
-- Total Loan Applications
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Loan_Applications FROM loan_data;

-- MTD Funded Amount (example for Dec 2021)
SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS MTD_Funded_Loan
FROM loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 12 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021;

-- Good Loan Percentage
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN loan_status IN ('Fully Paid', 'Current') THEN id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(id) AS Good_Loan_Percentage
FROM loan_data;
